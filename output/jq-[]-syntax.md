## what i learned
If you want to dump a list of objects you’re constructing from some other json you need to wrap your entire `jq` string in square brackets ( `[]` ). Otherwise you’ll be writing each object one at a time and that’s not valid JSON.
For example, running something like
```shell
jq '.[] | {id: .id, title: .title, created: .created }
```
returns →
```json
{
	id: "123",
	title: "page 1",
	created: "2022-01-25T23:15:00.000Z"
}
{
	id: "124",
	title: "page 2",
	created: "2022-01-26T13:18:15.000Z"
}
{
	id: "125",
	title: "page 3",
	created: "2022-01-27T18:37:05.000Z"
}
```
This file is not valid JSON. However, if you wrap your entire expression in square brackets `[]`  `jq` will group these all as a list of objects instead of appending each object at a time.
```shell
jq '[.[] | { id: .id, title: .title, created: .created }]'
```
returns →
```json
[
	{
		id: "123",
		title: "page 1",
		created: "2022-01-25T23:15:00.000Z"
	},
	{
		id: "124",
		title: "page 2",
		created: "2022-01-26T13:18:15.000Z"
	},
	{
		id: "125",
		title: "page 3",
		created: "2022-01-27T18:37:05.000Z"
	}
]
```
## how i learned
Testing the `til-notion-integration` and `markdownify-notion` I tried reading a list of TILs I had saved in a JSON file. However, each object was separated by a new line - not a comma.
## reference
The solution (after many failed google searches) was found on a GitHub issue answered by the creator of `jq` →
